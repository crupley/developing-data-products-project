# Sine Wave Generator
## shiny App deployment

This repo contains files to create a simple web application to be deployed on a shiny server. This application allows the user to visualize how three input parameters, amplitude, frequency, and phase, contribute to the plot of a sine wave. The three inputs can be controlled independently using sliders.
